      <li><h4>Brief Introduction</h4></li>
      <p>Since the beginning of the Quaternary, climate change has been associated with the North
          Sea’s development and its coastal regions. These climatic variations consist of cold (glacial),
          warm (interglacial) temperatures, and interstadial phases superimposed between the cold
          and warm temperature stages. By the end of the last glacial stage and the beginning of the
          Holocene, Sea level rose rapidly, leaving the entire North Sea as dry land bounded by
          massive Weichselian ice sheets and traces of periglacial deposits. The gradual decrease in
          the rising Sea level and the beginning of the Holocene ushered in the evolution of the
          Wadden Sea and the development of Holocene coastal features such as the Norderney
          barrier Island. The Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, also known as the Holocene base, was
          determined for this Island by applying hydroacoustic data, sediment core samples, and
          nearest neighbor spatial interpolation mehtod.
          Various studies have been carried out in the German North Sea coastal
          region to determine the Holocene base by scientists such Streif(2004),
          Bungestock and Schäfer(2009), and Alappat et al.(2010).</p>

      <li><h4>Aim of Study</h4></li>
      <p>This study focuses on establishing the boundary between the Holocene and Pleistocene
          sediments along the back-barrier region of the Norderney Island by creating an elevation
          surface model showing the relief and lateral extension of the Holocene base. It also aims to
          identify old channel systems and compare them with the recent channel surface of the study
          area.</p>
      <li><h4>Research questions</h4></li>
      <p><ol>
        <li>Does the morphology of the reconstructed boundary interface correlate with the
            previously designed Holocene base by Streif (1998)?</li>
        <li>How have remarkable Sea level change, erosion, tide impact, sediment reworking,
            and deposition affected the boundary interface and the recent channel topography?</li>
        <li>What role has the boundary interface played in the Holocene landscape development
            of the study area?</li>
      </ol></p>
