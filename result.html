    <h2>4.Result</h2>
    <p>Three interpolation methods were pre-selected for this study, and the best
       method was chosen and integrated with Streif's Holocene base. To be as precise
       as possible, the data point's surrounding area, which is the subtidal section of
       the back-barrier region of Norderney, was digitized as a Polygon.
       A digital terrain model (DTM) of 5m contour interval relative to the Normal Null
       (NHN) was produced.</p>

    <p>The Holocene base depths of these cores vary between 3.76m and 17.09m below present-day Sea
      level (NHN). Due to the irregular distribution of the cores, applying the inverse
      distance weighting (IDW) method generated low-quality results. In addition, the values of
      the data points were extrapolated outside their range, resulting in unnecessary topographical
      features that are irrelevant to the study. Unlike the Inverse distance weighting,
      the natural neighbor did not generate topographical features like peaks and ridges
      , except for those found within the study area. It also produced a smooth elevation of the
      Holocene base by assigning values within the interpolation range to regions with no data points.
       Because the search radius was modified to fulfill the aim of this study, the nearest neighbor
       approach did not assign values to areas with no data points. As a result, the data gaps were
       generated and represented as "?". The nearest neighbor interpolation will be utilized as the
       study proceeds to develop the most accurate Holocene base attainable.</p>

    <p>The relief of the Holocene base of the Busetief channel, Northwest-Southwest of the study area represented
     as channel A-A' has a terrain changing from low to higher elevations (-7m to -2m) in the North-South
      orientation. The Holocene base spanning the Riffgatt channel, marked as channel B-B' in the northwestern-
      southeastern section of the study area, ranges from -7 to -17m NHN. At the point of connection of the Channel
       B-B' to A-A,' there is a significant depression (Gully-like structure) with a depth variation between -17 and
        -22m NHN. This channel (B-B') is flanked by ridge-like deposition denoted as C-C' in the North and South directions
         of the base terrain. Further East of the study area, there was a change in the terrain from deeper depths to higher
          elevations in channel B-B'.</p>

        <li><h4>Elevation comparison of Streif's and the reconstructed Holocene base</h4></li>
        <p>In order to integrate Streif's Holocene base into this study, the topographic map of the Holocene base developed by Streif (fig.7) was recalculated (fig.14)
           with the same nearest neighbor gridding parameters adjusted within the Surfer 21 software for this study. There were parallels and disparities between the
           reconstructed Holocene/Pleistocene boundary (fig.13) developed from the compilation of these study datasets (cores and acoustic data) and the recalculated
           Streif's Holocene base (fig.14). In channel A-A' of Streif's Holocene base, the overall depth variation from the southern to the northern direction is between
            -2 to -22m NHN, with about fifty percent of the estimated area coverage between -7 to -12m NHN depth interval. In the reconstructed Holocene base, the overall
             depth variation is between -2 to -12m NHN, with -2 to -7m NHN depth interval making up more than sixty percent  of the estimated area of the channel A-A.'
             Similarly, the depth interval -17 to -22m of the Streif's Holocene base has the lowest area coverage (less than 10%) in the channel A-A', while the depth
             interval -7 to -12m NHN constitute the lowest area coverage in the reconstructed Holocene base.</p>

             </center>
             <p>Both Holocene bases across the Channel B-B' are generally identical in the East-West direction, except for regions of no-data present within the reconstructed Holocene
                base. At the point of connection of the channel B-B' to the North Sea, that is, the northwestern region of the study area, there is a transition from low to higher elevations.
                 At this transition in the Streif's base, a depth range of -17 to -2m NHN was detected, which was not the case for the reconstructed Holocene base (-17 to -7m NHN). For both
                 boundary contact surfaces, the depth interval with more than fifty percent area coverage at the western section of the channel B-B' is -12 to -17m NHN. Notable differences between
                  both boundary contacts of the channel B-B’ are between the depth interval -2 to -7m NHN, whereby in the Streif's Holocene base, this interval appears as little area pockets in the
                   North and South sections. While in the reconstructed Holocene base, a large portion of this depth interval is recorded farther to the East of the channel B-B’.</p>
            <p>Gully-like depressions are present in both boundaries but with different shapes and orientations. In the Streif's base, an oval-shaped gully structure with an estimated area of 0.92km²
               is present within the Channel B-B', and a slightly long gully with an estimated area of 0.19km² within the Channel A-A.' In the reconstructed Holocene base, the gully structure almost
               connecting channels A-A' and B-B' has an estimated surface area of 0.49km². The ridge-like depositions identified in the reconstructed Holocene base and denoted as C-C' are not readily
                apparent in Streif's base. </p>
            <p>Streif's Holocene base was combined with the reconstructed Holocene base by applying the grid mosaic command in the surfer 21 program software. This method approximated depth values for
               regions with no data inside the reconstructed Holocene base, and a new integrated Holocene base was created as a result(fig.15).</p>

        <li><h4>Comparison with the recent channel topography</h4></li>
        <p>The integrated Holocene base model was compared with the digital terrain model created from LiDAR and MBES bathymetric data (fig.8), reflecting the most recent topography of the subtidal channels
           in Norderney Island's back-barrier region (fig16). The tidal paleochannels A-A' and B-B' represent the recent Busetief and Norderneyer Riffgatt channels, respectively. The Busetief channel with
           Holocene base of A-A' has a relief ranging mostly between -7 and -2m NHN (fig.16) in the North to South direction. The Norderney Riffgatt channel with Holocene base of B-B' has a topographic elevation
            of 3 to -22m NHN, with the deepest section connecting directly to the North Sea. Flanking the Riffgatt channel in the North and South section are higher elevation depths ranging between 3m and -7m of
            the present-day Sea level (NHN). </p>

        <p>The volumetric difference between both topographies was estimated by superimposing the grid of the recent channels as the upper surface onto the grid of the integrated Holocene base as the lower surface
           (fig.17). The estimated volume above the lower surface is represented as the positive volume (Cut). Negative volume (Fill) is the estimated volume below the lower surface when an overlap occurs between
           the upper and lower surfaces. The cut & fill calculations revealed a positive volume of 4700cm³ of overburden sediments, with a negative volume of 210cm³, giving a net volume of about 4490cm³ of Holocene
           channel fill sediments. </p>
           <p>Four profiles from different study area locations within the Back-barrier region of Norderney were plotted to visually represent the volumetric differences between the recent channel and integrated Holocene
              base topographies. Profile A depicts the Busetief channel from northwest to southeast (red line). Profile B represents the point at which the channels connect to the open North Sea in the North-South direction
               (pink line). Profiles C (black line) portray the Riffgatt channels in the West-East direction, and profile D (orange line) depicts the continuation of the Riffgatt channel in the same direction as profile C.
               In the various profiles, the blue segment reflects the Holocene sediment body, separated from the Pleistocene sediments (yellow) by a thin black line that functions as the boundary contact between both sediment bodies.</p>
