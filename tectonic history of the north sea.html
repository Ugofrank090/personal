        <h2>2.Tectonic history of the North Sea</h2>
  <p>The North Sea is a partly enclosed epi-continental marine ecosystem situated between the United Kingdom,
  Northern Europe, and Scandinavia (Ducrotoy et al., 2013), with a free passage to the Baltic Sea via the
  Skagerrak (Schwarzer et al., 2008). Due to the obvious neighboring landmasses, the North Sea is more
  sheltered than other areas of the European shelf (Cohen et al., 2017). Its depth ranges between 50 – 400m
  and 500km in width (Philips et al., 2017; Lamb et al., 2017).
  The present outlook of the North Sea is mainly an outcome of extensive geological processes such as rifting,
  thermal subsidence, and sediment deposition resulting from climatic oscillation (Streif, 2004; Glennie & Underhill,
  1998; Ziegler, 1992). </p>
      <ol>
      <li><h4>The Quaternary period of the North Sea</h4></li>
  <p>This geologic period started about 2.58 million years ago and continues until today.
  It is best known and described as the period of alternating cold and warm cycles, thus,
  supporting the various lithostratigraphic units we see today (Ehlers et al., 2018;
  Elias & Holloway, 2013; Schaumann et al., 2019). Chronostratigraphically, it is partitioned
  into the Pleistocene epoch (2.58Ma – 11,000 yr BP), characterized by long periods of freezing
  temperatures intercalated with shorter warm intervals, followed by the Holocene epoch
  (11,000 yr BP – Present).Conventionally, three cold stages identified and sequentially
  recorded as marine isotope stages "MIS" within sediment succession of the German North
  Sea sector's Quaternary development (A. G. C. Graham et al., 2008) are the Elsterian(MIS 12),
  Saalian(MIS 10-6), and Weichsaalian(MIS 5d-2). These cold stages were separated by warm episodes
  known as the Holsteinian, Eemian, and Holocene (Coughlan et al., 2018; Graham et al., 2008;
  Sindowski, 1970). Nevertheless, Stewart & Lonergan (2011), alongside Graham et al. (2011),
  have shown that 7 phases of cold stages between 500 – 40 ka cut into the Quaternary sub-glacial
  tunnel valleys in the central North Sea, but the Elsterian extensively signifies the first cold
  period within the German North Sea region. </p>

          <li><h4>Pleistocene history of the German North Sea region</h4></li>
  <p>Sediment records have indicated several phases of warm and cold climate experienced during the
  Pleistocene epoch. These phases of climatic variations brought about the German North Sea
  sector's landscape evolution and development. Streif (2004) summarised the Pleistocene development
  of this region into: <ul>
    <li>A marine fluvio – deltaic system during the Early Pleistocene.</li>
    <li>A stage classified by repeated ice advances, with interchanging periods of marine transgression during the Middle to Late Pleistocene.</li>
    <li>The final stage in which the most recent ice sheets began to melt, resulting in present-day
       Landscape development seen around the German North Sea sector.</li>

          <li><h4>Holocene history of the German North Sea region</h4></li>
  <p>
    This interglacial period started about 11,560 years BP (Streif, 2004) and continues until today.
  However, before this warm period, the climate at about 18,000 years, BP experienced an improved
  condition that led to the melting of the Late Weichselian ice, followed by a global rise in the
  Sea level (Cameron et al., 1993; Laban, 2000). Glacio-isostatic subsidence, plate tectonics, sediment
  compaction, and the tide's changing influence (Streif & Köstner, 1978; Schaumann et al., 2019) boosted
  the rising Sea level. Effects of the Sea level rise were a series of erosions and sediment depositions
  along the North Sea region. Streif (2004) comprehensively described the Holocene transgression experienced
  along the southern North Sea and classified its history into three Phases;<ul>
    <li><b>18,000 – 10,250 years BP:</b> Regarded as the first phase of Holocene transgression, Sea level rose
    from about 130m to 72m below the present-day mean Sea level. The flooding experienced gradually
    covered the entire North Sea basin, thus initiating glaciomarine to marine sediment deposition above the
    Weichselian deposits of terrestrial, glaciofluvial, and morainic origin, seen today in relicts of palleovalleys
    along the central North Sea (Cameron et al., 1993). </li>
    <li><b>10,250 – 7,100 years BP:</b> A constant rising Sea level characterizes the second phase by an initial rate
    of 1.5m/century and later by a higher rate of 2.1m/century. Sea level rose from 72m - 25m below the present-day Sea
    level, but at about 65m below the present-day mean Sea level in 10,000 years BP, a foray of brackish water entered
    into the southern North Sea basin from the low area existing between the Dogger Bank and East Anglia (Eisma et al., 1981).
    The rapidly rising Sea level brought about the landward shift of the shoreline alongside reworked Pleistocene and initial
    Holocene sediments. Other significant events of this phase are the extensive deposition of tidal flat sediments between 9,000 –
    8,000 years BP and the linking of the southern North Sea to the mid-Atlantic at about 8,300 years BP.</li>
    <li><b>7,500 years BP – Present-day:</b> Sea level rise continued at a decelerating pace from 25m to the present-day mean Sea level.
       The connection of the southern North Sea via the Dover Strait to the Middle Atlantic initiated a complete marine condition after
       7,000 years BP. As a result, a wedge-like body of Holocene coastal sediments and present-day coastal landscapes such as
       the barrier Islands, tidal flats, and vast coastal marshlands evolved. During this phase, alternating cycles of transgressive and
       regressive overlaps occurred, bringing about the coastline's displacement both seaward and landward in a repeated pattern (Hoselmann & Streif, 2004). </li>
  </ul></p>
  <p>The Holocene sediment wedge developed during the rising Sea level and striking parallel to the southern North sea's coastline constitutes
     a 10-25 km wide area (Schwarzer et al., 2008). It extends between 80-100 km inland off the Wesser and Elbe rivers' estuaries, with a thickness
     greater than 35m sediments filling up deeply engraved tidal channels in the barrier Island regions (Hoselmann & Streif, 2004). Above the barrier
     Islands are aeolian dunes of sand of about 25-30m thickness, while in the back-barrier region, the tidal flats and coastal marshlands thinned out
      and eventually terminated at the landward Pleistocene deposit, otherwise referred to as "Geest." (Streif, 2004). This region's sediment composition
      s a sequence of fine sand, silt, clay, and alternating peat layers that originated during the rising groundwater table and flooding of the coastal
      landscape (Schwarzer et al., 2008; Streif, 2004). These peat layers function as the boundary between the Pleistocene and Holocene sediments. Hence,
      they are referred to as Basal peat by several authors. </p>

      <li><h4>Human influence in the North Sea</h4></li>
  <p>Human occupation and habitation in the North Sea coast began in the Early Cromerian times (Parfit et al., 2005, 2010; Schaumann et al., 2019), and its coastal
     development, particularly in the northwestern Dutch-German Wadden Sea region, have been influenced by the changing Sea level and sinking of the coastal
     bog peats (Vos & Knol, 2015). Rings of dykes were introduced to protect against the devastating effect of the rising Sea level. These rings of dykes functioned
     as links between the brackish and fresh water zones.</p>
      <li><h4>Norderney</h4></li>
  <p>The Norderney Island, located between latitude 53.7078˚N and longitude 7.1413˚E, is a member of the Southern North Sea coast's East Frisian Islands.
    It is approximately 5000 years old and has about 25.3km² areas, with an average width of 2km (Sindowski 1973; Streif, 1990). It is separated from its
    neigborhring Islands by the Norderneyer Seegatt and Wichter Ee. Like the other East Frisian Islands, it continuously migrates to the East (Fitzgerald, 2015)
    . The western part is protected against tide actions and on the eastern part is an accumulation of sand deposits (Streif, 1990). </p>
