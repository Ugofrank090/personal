      <li><h4>The significance of hydroacoustic and core data integration</h4></li>
    <p>Streif's reconstruction of the Holocene base was based solely on the application
       of cores collected across the back-barrier section of Norderney Island during the
        late sixties and seventies of the last century. The compilation of hydroacoustic
        data collected with the SES-2000 Standard Plus parametric echo sounder and new core
         samples enabled identifying the exact depth locations of the boundary interface between
          the Island's Holocene-Pleistocene deposits, leading to the development of an integrated
          Holocene base surface. The potential to map the lateral distribution of the Holocene base
          deposit and identify regions where there were direct connections between Holocene-Pleistocene
          deposits is evidence of the integration of these new datasets. </p>
    <p>According to Strief (1998), the geologic boundary (fig.14) between the study area's Holocene and
      Pleistocene deposits varies between -2 and -22m NHN, which is comparable to the reconstructed Holocene
       base developed for this study (fig.13). It was possible to identify ridge-like structures in the North
        and South directions of the Riffgatt channel within the reconstructed Holocene base (fig.13) and rarely
         possible in the Streif's Holocene base(fig.14). Furthermore, across the Riffgatt channel of the Streif's
          Holocene base, the depth range of -7 to -12m NHN comprised more than half of the entire channel’s area
          coverage. In contrast, this depth interval was considerably more concentrated in the northwestern section
           of the same channel in the reconstructed Holocene base and was just about fifty percent of the channel’s
            area coverage. Likewise, in the Busetief channel, Northwest – Southeast of the back-barrier region of Norderney
            , the reconstructed Holocene base indicated that the elevation of this channel was much higher than previously
             described by Strief(1998). It was observed in the result (fig.13) that as the Holocene base laterally extended
             seaward,  there was a change in the elevation interval from -2 to -7m NHN and eventually to the deepest depth
             interval of  -17 to -22m NHN, which was not the same for the Streif's Holocene base. </p>
      <p>However, on both Holocene base surfaces, there were regions with similar depth relationships. The depth range for
          both Holocene base surfaces in the northwestern region of the study area was between -12 and -17m NHN.  Further east
           of the Riffgatt channel, the base undulated between -2 to -12m NHN in the East-West direction.
            The limited data in the reconstructed Holocene base was due to the poor reflective conditions of the hydroacoustic data obtained
             for this study and the interpolation method adopted. Hence, the integration of Streif’s Holocene base with the reconstructed Holocene
              base (fig.15) since there were some similarities between both surfaces.</p>
      <li><h4>Sediment composition of the Holocene base</h4></li>
      <p>Based on the examined datasets employed in this study (fig.10), the Holocene base is characterized by soil, subtidal channel sand, intertidal
         sand, and peat deposition, otherwise referred to as the basal peat (Streif, 2004). These sediments were found at different base depths of the
         study area. Notably, the regions with subtidal channel sand as the base were generally between Holocene base depth intervals of -9 to -22m NHN,
          while the basal peat and soil depositions were between -2 to -9m NHN. The Holocene base at the Busetief channel identified in ten (10) core samples
           and integrated with their corresponding acoustic lines were predominantly basal peat deposits formed between 8000 – 3000 Yr BP(Alappat et al., 2010;
            K. E. Behre, 2004). These accounted for more than half of the boundary’s sediment composition in the North-South direction.</p>
      <p>Similarly, in the Norderney Riffgatt channel, forty (40) core samples were identified as having a Holocene base, with a large concentration of these cores
         in the channels’ northwestern region (fig.10), and the sediment composition of the Holocene base having less than forty percent of the basal peat. The basal
         peat, which comprises plant remains, was formed due to the Sea level and groundwater table rising simultaneously and drowning coastal areas (Alappat et al.,
         2010; Schwarzer et al., 2008). The lateral distribution of the basal peat deposits in the study area confirms the reduced erosional impulse of the subsequent
          marine transgression (Karle et al., 2021) at the end of the last glaciation and a significant, continuous landward migration of the coastline (Streif, 1990b,
          2004). Fossil podsolic soils developed in the late Pleistocene to early Holocene were identified in both channels of the study area, indicating the process of
           pedogenesis (Karle et al., 2021; Streif, 2004).</p>
      <p>Although the peat deposition often marks the beginning of the Holocene deposition (Schwarzer et al., 2008), the frequent flooding and intensive scouring by tidal
         erosion has left the Pleistocene sediments reworked, exposed, and in most cases in direct contact with the overlying marine Holocene sediments (Karle et al., 2021;
          R. M. Schaumann et al., 2021) notably in the northwestern section of the Riffgatt channel. </p>
      <li><h4>The relationship between the Holocene base and the study area's landscape development</h4></li>
      <p>The current topography of Norderney's back-barrier section has been linked to several geologic processes and human impact that has prevailed at various stages since
         the end of the Ice age. These processes, such as Sea level rise, erosion, sediment reworking, sediment deposition, diking, and land reclamation, shaped the morphology
         and topographic relief of the entire German North Sea coast (Alappat et al., 2010; K. E. Behre, 2004; R. M. Schaumann et al., 2021; Streif, 2004). This is apparent in
         the volumetric estimation derived from the superimposition of recent channel terrain with the integrated Holocene base (fig.17). The estimation revealed the overlying
          Holocene sediments to be relatively thin across the entire study area (less than five m³). Cross-sectional profiles A-D in figure 17 indicated the different roles each
           geologic process mentioned above played in shaping the study area's current outlook. </p>
      <p>Profile A extending from North-South over 5.5km in the northwestern region of the study area represents the Busetief channel. As observed, it depicts a development with
        Holocene deposition thinning out towards the Pleistocene hinterland, which is the general situation of the German North Sea section (Streif, 1990, 2004). The landscape
        development of this channel has been attributed to the significant input of sediments from the open North Sea to the Norderney Island's back-barrier section as a result
         of the decelerating rising Sea level(Streif,2004) and the minimal contribution of sediments from the hinterland’s significant rivers (Oost et al., 2012). </p>
      <p>Profile B, C, & D extends across the Riffgatt channel from Northwest-Southeast of the study area. They represent a development that has been actively affected by the continuous
         flooding, erosion, and exposure of the Holocene base, which in most cases have been washed away or reworked with the Pleistocene sand (Streif, 2004). The Holocene sediments are
          mostly fine-medium grain sands, suggesting that they were deposited under high energy conditions (Schwarzer et al., 2008; Streif, 2004). A significant amount of Holocene sediments
           were retained farther to the East and on the Riffgatt channels' ridges in the North and South directions, as observed in profile D of figure 17. This development demonstrates the
            steady reduction in the channel's high energy system and the decelerating rising Sea level during the Late Holocene (Streif, 1990, 2004). </p>
