    <h2>Summary & Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Detecting the Holocene base in the back-barrier region of the Norderney was
       achievable using cores and hydroacoustic datasets collected during two geophy
       sical survey periods. These cores, amounting to 156 samples, were narrowed
       down based on the existence of a geologic boundary between the terrestrial
       Pleistocene sand and the Holocene marine sediments to 50 core samples. As
       observed, the cores with the existing Holocene base were all collected from
        the subtidal section of the study area.  Hence, there was a need for this
        section to be enclosed within a digitized polygon. Hydroacoustic lines wi
        thin the enclosed polygon were combined with their corresponding cores. </p>
    <p>The Pleistocene-Holocene boundary identified by a strong reflector with
        high amplitudes, depicting the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene
        deposition, was digitized and exported as data points for further analysis.
      A spatial interpolation approach was required due to the uneven distribution
       of the exported data points. Because the search radius could be adjusted to
       fulfill the research's goal, the nearest neighbor interpolation was chosen,
        and a DTM of the study area was developed. Comparisons were made between
        the newly reconstructed Holocene base and Streifâ€™s recalculated Holocene
        base map. There were similarities and differences between both terrains.
        However, there were data gaps in the newly reconstructed Holocene base due
         to the lack of data points caused by the poor reflective quality of some
         acoustic data, as well as the absence of cores with Holocene base present.
          A compilation of both Holocene bases resulted in an integrated DTM.  The
           superimposition of the recent channel topography of the study area with
            the integrated DTM identified the deposition above the Holocene base to
             be relatively thin, that is, less than five meters in thickness.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, a combination of sedimentary and hydroacoustic data in the
       back-barrier area of Norderney only provided information about the boundary
        between the Quaternary sediments of the subtidal section of the Island.
        It was impossible to determine the boundary across the intertidal section
         due to the limited length (6m) of the cores collected in this region and
          the impossibility of collecting hydroacoustic data. To generate detailed
           information on the boundary interface within the intertidal section, the
            length of the cores should be extended, and the coring system changed.</p>
