    <h2>3.Methodology</h2>
    <p>Borehole samples and hydroacoustic data were applied to achieve the aim of this study.
       These data, collected from the back-barrier region of the Norderney Island, span over two
       years, from 2016 – 2018. The Holocene-Pleistocene boundary was initially detected in the cores
        collected over the study area and eventually matched with their corresponding hydroacoustic
        reflectors. This boundary interface, otherwise referred to as the Holocene base, was digitized
        along the sub-bottom hydroacoustic lines using the Innomar ISE post-processing software. The
        Geographic coordinates alongside varying depths ("XYZ" data) of each acoustic reflector aided
        the geostatistical modeling of a two-dimension elevation surface of the Holocene base of the
        Norderney back-barrier area. </p>

        <ul>
          <li><h4>Sub-bottom profiling</h4></li>
          <p>Hydroacoustic data were collected from the subtidal section of the back-barrier region of
             Norderney using the parametric sounder SES-2000 Standard Plus mounted on the Senckenberg
              research vessel of the Senckenberg Institute. The SES-2000 is a non-linear, high-resolution device
               developed by INNOMAR'S Technology. The first set of hydroacoustic lines (April 2016) acquired in the
                southern section of Norderney runs parallel to the Norderneyer Riffgatt channel. This channel
                 is a tidal inlet connecting the Wadden Sea to the North Sea, and it cuts deep into the Holocene and
                 Pleistocene deposits. The WASA group named three long acoustic lines collected during this survey period
                 into South, North, and Central lines. As the research vessel traveled North-South along the Norderneyer Riffgatt
                 channel, several crosslines (transects) were extracted over these lines. Additional transects parallel to the Busetief
                  channel and perpendicular to the three long lines of 2016 were gathered in March and April of 2018 to provide complete
                  acoustic information of the Island's subtidal region. </p>

          <li><h4>Cores</h4></li>
          <p>Cores collected across the entire Norderney area during the sub-bottom profiling summed up to 156 samples. However, since this study is
             restricted to the Island's back-barrier region, the offshore cores are subtracted, bringing it down to 108 cores. These cores
             were collected in three survey periods, that is, from 2016 – 2018. Subtidal located cores were collected using a VKG-6 electronic
             vibrocorer installed on a crane aboard the RV Senckenberg and RV Buchanna, while a manual coring system was used in the
             intertidal areas. SeaPath System with applied RTK-corrections of the Konsberg Maritime was deployed for exact positioning.</p>

      <p>The Holocene base of the back-barrier region of Norderney proposed by Streif will be applied to this study. Streif's Holocene base was determined
        from borehole samples collected along Germany's North Sea coast by the Lower Saxon State Office for Soil Research (NLfB). This base will be recalculated
        into a new digital terrain model (DTM), compared, and integrated with the reconstructed Holocene base.</p>

        <li><h4>LiDAR and Bathymetric data of the recent surface area</h4></li>
      <p>LiDAR stands for Light Detection and Ranging. It is a laser-based remote sensing system that directs a tiny laser at a subject and determines the time
         it takes for the laser to return to its source. This technology is used to create a digital elevation model (DEM) or a digital terrain model (DTM) for
          3D mapping in geographical information systems (GIS). For this study, the LiDAR data for the intertidal and MBES-(Multibeam echosounder) based bathymetric
           data for the subtidal back-barrier section of the study area courtesy of the Lower Saxony State Office for Water Management, Coastal and Nature Conservation
            Coastal Research Center (NLWKN) will be utilized.</p>

        <li><h4>Data processing and evaluation</h4></li>
        <p>QGIS software aided the visualization of the location of cores and acoustic data on the Norderney base map. This software was essential in
          selecting cores with a Holocene base and their corresponding acoustic lines. The acoustic survey lines were selected based on a ten-meter
          (10m) offset correlation with cores having an established Holocene base and an excellent reflective quality. The acoustic lines were processed using the
          INNORMAR SES-2000 Post-Processing program ISE. Tide gauges and Sea depths were adjusted for individual acoustic lines selected based on their proximity
          to cores with the existing Holocene base. These cores were imported as ASCII files into the ISE software and overlaid on their corresponding acoustic lines.
          The boundary contact reflector between the Holocene and Pleistocene deposits resulting from merging both datasets was digitized for each selected transect.
          The values for longitudes, latitudes, and depths (NHN) were imported into the Surfer 21 software for further analysis in CSV format. A typical illustration
          of this processing step is represented in fig.9 below.  </p><ul>

          <li><h4>Spatial analysis</h4></li>
      <p>Spatial analysis manipulates spatial data to extract new information and meaning from the original data. One way to generate new information is usually through
         spatial interpolations. Interpolation is a statistical process of utilizing data collected as point features such as GPS readings and borehole samples of a known
         region to estimate and extract information for nearby unknown regions. Generally, there are different interpolation methods, and no single method can solve
          all spatial problems. Furthermore, different methods produce different spatial results. Some are more exact and useful, while some could take longer to compute; hence,
           they all have merits and demerits. Applying an unsuitable method or inappropriate parameters can result in a distorted spatial distribution model, leading to potentially
            wrong decisions (Mitas & Mitasova, 1999).</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, it is advisable to try out several suitable methods for the available data type and select the best. Some of the most common interpolations are Kriging,
          Triangulation, Nearest Neighbor, Inverse distance weighting, and Natural Neighbor. </p>
